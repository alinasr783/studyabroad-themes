# Study Abroad Platform Migration

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive study abroad/education platform that has been successfully migrated from Lovable to Replit environment. The platform includes:

- Public-facing pages for countries, universities, and programs
- Admin interface for content management
- Platform management for multi-client operations
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Express.js backend with TypeScript
- React frontend with modern UI components

## Recent Changes
- **2025-01-18**: Fixing Vercel deployment configuration
  - User reported that Vercel deployment shows compiled JS code instead of website
  - Updated vercel.json to treat as static site with Supabase backend
  - Configured proper build command and output directory
  - Supabase credentials already configured in client code

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + API)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with existing schema
- **Security**: Supabase RLS and built-in authentication

## User Preferences
- User prefers Supabase over Replit backend
- Focus on fixing admin dashboard functionality
- Ensure all features work completely with Supabase
- Admin forms for adding countries/universities/programs must work properly

## Current Issues
- Vercel deployment configuration needs to be properly set for static site
- Error message in console: "لم يتم العثور على عميل لهذا الدومين" (Client not found for this domain)

## Next Steps
1. Test Vercel deployment with updated configuration
2. Fix domain-based client detection issue
3. Ensure proper static site deployment
